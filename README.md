## Project Purpose

This website was created primarily as a **learning project** to practice and improve my web development skills.  
It is my first more advanced project where I combined HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and basic PHP into a fully responsive layout.  

All content, texts, and media on the site are used for **educational and entertainment purposes only** — this is not a commercial or official team website.  
The goal of this project was to experiment with modern web layouts, semantic HTML, and interactive UI elements while having fun creating something visually appealing.
